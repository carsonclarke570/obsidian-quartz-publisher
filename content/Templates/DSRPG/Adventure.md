## You 
> *Start by establishing the current situation of the player characters at the beginning of this particular plot. What are they currently doing? Where are they? What is their immediate goal?*

## Need
> *Make the player characters feel a need. Don't call itÂ hook, make sure the player characters are invested and feel a desperate need to do something.*

## Go
> *The player characters enter a new situation. They leave their comfort zone and enter a new world. This is the point of no return.*

## Search
> *This is the stage of the challenges. The player characters are tested and they face their fears. They are forced to adapt to the new situation.*

## Find
> *The player characters highly likely have to achieve what they set off for, but they have to pay a price: what they get is what the want, but not what they need.*

## Take
> *Time to create a situation in which the player characters can switch from what they want to what they need. This is the moment of realisation.*

## Return
> *The player characters fight to get what they need, and in doing so they return to the world they know.*

## Change
> *The player characters have changed, and they should see the effect of their actions in the world they know.*
