## Civil Unrest
A civil war is brewing in the Elk Province between House Ristaway and House Cranford. General Iona of House Ristaway is secretly fanning the flames of this war with the intent of using the chaos to destabilize all the major houses of the Elk Province as part of her "No kings. No rulers. No chains." manifesto. Meanwhile, King Aodh Ristaway is using abducted engineers from Troskett College to develop the world's first militarized air fleet. **Depending on the choices of the players either:**
- *House Ristaway wins the civil war and maintains control of the throne. King Aodh Ristaway launches the capital's secret airship fleet against the Horse Province.*
- *House Cranford wins the civil war and gains control of the throne. House Ristaway destroys the airship fleet once the capital falls and the lead engineer flees back to Troskett College with the air fleet plans.*
- *General Iona succeeds in her coup and commandeers Aodh's fleet resulting in the collapse of the Elk Province's noble houses. She then sends the fleet to Fort Hardune to bolster defenses against the Ravenkin.*

## Blood & Stone Under The Desert Sun
Several reports have come in from Dragonsguard scouts that the Ravenkin in the Southern Wastes are congregating and showing signs of organization on scales that Ravenkin are not known to operate on. Deep in the Wastes, a group of Consipirators chosen by Myrk called the Raven's Hands are leading the Ravenkin and building a nearly unstoppable siege engine contraption called the Chaos Engine. **At some point the players will have the option to destroy the Chaos Engine or prevent the main host of the Ravenkin armies from reaching Raven's Gap**
- *Stopping the Chaos Engine will prevent the device from being completed but allow the main host to reach Raven's Gap.*
- *Sending word to Raven's Gap will allow the Ravenskin to successfully complete the Chaos Engine.*

## A New Kind of Danger
The Applied Sciences department at Troskett College has recently managed to create an steam engine capable of 99% efficient energy transfer by using Ashyndrite, a material that until now was thought only useful as spell components. This prompted the founding of a new department at the college called Magical Technology or "Magitech" for short.

After this breakthrough several Magitech engineers have begun being poached or even abducted by the various countries to develop military technologies. Rumors spread of air ships and new sea vessels being developed in secret across the land. 

One group of Magitech engineers have developed a new weapon called Aesurbolts, a device that rips un-distilled energy from the Realm of Spirit. This manifests as bolt of raw energy. **At some point the players will have to choose let this technology free into the world or destroy the plans for the technology.**
- *Preventing the technology from being distributed allows the Pariahal Kinlands to invade the Horse Province unopposed.*
- *Allowing the technology to be distributed will:*
	- *Let the Aesurbolts fall into the hands of Consipirators who will launch an assault against Troskett College in an attempt to get Magitech research for their Chaos Engine. 
	- *Allow the Dragonsguard will be able to use it in their fights against the Ravenkin*

Note:
- Troskett College is divided into two departments, Arcane Arts and Applied Sciences filled with Scholars and Engineers respectively.
