> [!bonfire] Graveyard Bonfire 
> **Status:** Discovered
> When the party awakens from the dead they will find themselves beside an unlit bonfire.

![[Cemetery of Ash#1. The Graveyard|no-h clean]]

> [!recite] Recite - Waking Up Dead
> You open your eyes and for a moment the world seems blurry -- but you blink away the dust that's begun to layer upon your eyes and  groan. This is not the first time the call of the flame has brought you to life somewhere inconvenient. You sit up and look around to confirm your worst suspicions: someone -- or something -- has dragged your previously lifeless corpse to a graveyard to die among your kind.
> 
> For a moment you think you're the only one that the curse has called back but you soon hear three other Kindled Undead taking sputtering breaths around you. Would you all like to take a moment and describe what your characters look like?

- The players will have a moment to introduce themselves and get oriented

> [!recite] Recite - The First Bonfire
> In the clearing of bodies, tombs and stone structures you awoke in is a familiar sight to many of you -- a bonfire. It beckons you to call forth it's latent flames.

- Player can either use an item or spell to light the bonfire or make a Bonfire Check.

> [!check]- Bonfire Check - DC12 Wisdom (Survival)
> On a success the bonfire is lit allowing the players to take a Long rest or level up at it.

- If the players try to make it out of the graveyard they will be attacked by a group of hostile skeletons and undead dogs.

> [!encounter]
> ### Encounter Info
> - The party will have to roll Perception against the dogs' Stealth to see who sees who first.
> - One skeleton has a Short Bow and the other has a Scimitar and Shield.

# 2. The Crossroads
![[Cemetery of Ash#2. The Crossroads|no-h clean]]

> [!recite] The Crossroads
> Immediately outside the gates of the graveyard you find yourselves on a mountain path high above the land of Lothric below. It seems the stone walls of the graveyard were actually natural features of the mountaintop.
> 
> The mountain trail reveals three paths forward. Two towards Lothric: One toward a towering, decrepit shrine guarding what looks like the only safe path down the mountain and another toward an abandoned building surrounded by an iron gate. The last path goes away from Lothric and seems nearly un-traversable the further it goes however in the not-too-far distance you see two figures standing idly along the path. 
>> [!check]- DC15 Perception  
>> With an X perception check, you also see a crevice in the mountainside by you that was obscured by shadow and rocks. Within it you see a man resting against the walls of the crevice with his head slumped in defeat.

At this point the players may take several different actions:
> [!check]- Talking to the man in the crevice
> The man will reveal himself as [[Thops the Failure|Thops]] and be dejected about attempting to best a beast within the crevice. After failing to graduate from a magic academy far away he came to Lothric to learn crystal sorceries and bring them back to his home of Liurnia. He unfortunately lost his notes on the spell when attempting to document a creature he discovered within the crevice. He warns the party that the creature is quite fearsome and to move along while he thinks of a way out of his predicament.
>> [!npc]- Thops
>> ![[Thops the Failure|clean no-h]]

> [!check]- Going into the crevice
> - Go to [[#3. Crystal Lizard's Den]]

> [!check]- Checking out the figures on the path
> - Make an encounter check [[Cemetery of Ash#Encounter Table]]
> - Go to [[#4. Carim Way]]

# 3. Crystal Lizard's Den
![[Cemetery of Ash#3. Crystal Lizard's Den|clean no-h]]

> [!recite] Crystal Den
> Further into the crevice, the walls widen to reveal a clearing of blue crystal rock formations. The crystals jut out of rocks at angle and sizes that almost seem unnatural.
>> [!check]- DC14 Group Perception
>> You see what you original mistook as one of the many rocky outcropping in the clearing is actually a massive lizard covered in more of the blue crystal rocks. It seems to be a larger species of the small crystal lizards that are ever so common to Lothric and is sleeping quietly on the other end of the clearing.

- Warn the players that this foe looks particularly strong before combat

> [!encounter]
> ### Encounter Info
> - If the players pass the perception check they will get a surprise round on the lizard.
> 
> ```encounter
> name: Ravenous Crystal Lizard
> creatures:
>   - 1: [[Ravenous Crystal Lizard]]

# 4. Carim Way
![[Cemetery of Ash#4. Carim Way|clean no-h]]

> [!recite] A Duo From Carim
> As you approach the figures, their forms become more clear. A woman in a white blindfold and a dirty pilgrims gown lies idly on a rock while a heavily armored man paces back and forth beside a massive great hammer.

- If not stealthing, the woman will notice you and ask her companion who approaches. They will introduce themselves as [[Eygon of Carim]] and [[Irina of Carim]].

> [!check]- Talking to [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] and [[Irina of Carim|Irina]]
> [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will inform the party that they came to Lothric seeking to join the order of Firekeepers. Unfortunately they could not seem to get by [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|Iudex Gundyr]] and decided to turn back to Carim only to find that the mountain path had finally crumbled past the point of possible travel. They will mention that the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum]] had an armory that could potentially contain some weapons.
> - [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will be quick to help while [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] will be distrustful and on guard. 
> - [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will offer to teach some miracles to ease the pain of travel.
> 
> When the party leaves, [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will convince [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] to give the party the [[Keys#Asylum Grounds Keyring]] which will let the party open doors around the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#1. Outer Grounds]] of the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum]] 

# 5. Gundyr's Post
![[Cemetery of Ash#6. Gundyr's Post|clean no-h]]

> [!recite] Gundyr's Post
> You approach a large archway that leads to collapsed circle guard house. Most of the ceilings and walls has fallen away to reveal the interior. This gives the guard house the appearance of an arena. To the right is a steep and perilous decline into the lands of Lothric below and directly ahead of you, blocking a large stone door, is a huge statue of a knight impaled by a sword.
> 
> Many of you recognize this as the Coiled Sword of [[Firelink Shrine]]. It calls to you to remove it from the statue and bring it home to its rightful place back at the shrine beyond.

- The only way to progress is to remove the Coiled Sword and defeat [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|Iudex Gundyr]]
