![[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#1. Outer Grounds|clean no-h]]

- Do an encounter table roll as they approach the entrance to the asylum

> [!recite] Entrance
> You approach an old building made of stone and wrought iron. It's only one-story tall but you can tell that the foundation of the building goes deep. Rumors have been circulating that the building was once an old army barrack for [[Firelink Shrine]] and that perhaps there are still weapons somewhere deep within.
> 
> As you stand outside you notice an unkindled bonfire not too far from the building's dilapidated entrance.
>> [!check] DC 12 Perception 
>> As you near this building you notice something strange, or rather the lack of something strange. There is no sound of the scratching, howling or screaming that is often accompanied by the presence of hollows.

> [!bonfire] Asylum Entrance
> **Status:** Undiscovered
> When the party defeats the boars they will find the asylum entrance.

# 2. First Floor Cells
![[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#2. First Floor Cells|clean no-h]]

> [!recite] The Asylum
> As you pass the threshold of the building you see firsthand the only fate worse than being left to rot in the Cemetery of Ash. The outer rim of the first floor of this building is lined with prison cells and torture devices. In a few of the cells are the skeletal remains of Hollows that likely spent their mad lives being tortured by their wardens until eventually their bones and sinew could no longer hold the remaining husk of their humanity together. You shudder at the idea of being one of these poor souls. 
> 
> You are broken out of your temporary stupor by a sound from below. Your attention turns to the inner rim of the first floor where a series of bars and railings overlook an atrium below. Within the atrium is a large, bulbous demon carrying a giant mace. It's attention seems to be strictly on the floor below as it patrols back and forth.
> 
> You don't immediately see a safe path down to the atrium but you imagine you might be able to find something by exploring the cells around you.
>> [!check]  DC 12 Perception 
>> Same as previous check.

- **Encounter Table Roll** if the player decide to try to find a way down after handling the below:

> [!recite] Exploring
> As you make your way through the cells, you hear a familiar, human noise: someone coughing. Approaching the noise you see a woman in a dirty leather armor and a smiths apron locked away in one of the few intact cells. She coughs into her hand and groans slightly but does not seem to have taken notice of you. 
>> [!check] [[Oedo]]/Jim - DC 12 History w/Advantage
>> [[Oedo]] will recognize this as the Master Weaponsmith [[Helena of Astora]], the woman who crafted his armor as well as his brothers -- the Ashmetal Armors.
>> 
>> Jim will recognize this as the sister of the Master Jeweler Enrique. You studied under Enrique when learning to be a locksmith. You feel a great sadness when you recall this but you aren't sure why yet. A faded memory sits beyond your grasp for now.

- [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] will automatically recognize [[Oedo]] and become alert

>[!check]- Talking to [[Helena of Astora|Helena]]
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] will explain that she and her two brothers were afflicted by the curse and the Mad King Oceiros attempted to imprison the three of them at the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum|Old Asylum]]. Enrique escaped before he could be sent away but Andre and [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] were imprisoned in the Asylum where they discovered that the mysterious wardens of the Asylum were actually demons.
> 
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] learned that the Asylum had been out of contact with Castle Lothric for so long that the original wardens had passed away and demons had made their home there. For years [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] was forced to make armor for the demons in return for being tortured less often.
> 
> Her brother Andre eventually went Hollow and was released along with the other Hollows as part of a plan to set them loose on Lothric.
> 

- [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] will let the players know that the current warden in the atrium has a series of keys that could let her out. She will also let the party know that her forge materials are somewhere down below the atrium.


> [!check]- Looking for a way down
> The players will find a staircase leading down to the atrium as well as several sections of railings that are broken providing a relatively safe manner of jumping down.

# 3. The Atrium
![[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#3. The Atrium|clean no-h]]

> [!recite]
> The atrium is supported by four pillars and feels cramped as the demon takes up a significant portion of the room. It's a wonder how it managed to fit in the room in the first place.

> [!encounter]
> 
>```encounter
>name: Asylum Warden
>creatures:
> - 1: Asylum Demon
>```
>#### Rewards
> - Great Mace
> - [[Keys#Asylum Cells Keyring]]
> - **Each**
> 	- 1000 Souls
> 	- 1x Roll on [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#Treasure Table]]

- When the [[Asylum Demon]] dies he will leave behind a Bonfire

> [!bonfire] `=this.bonfires[1].sublocation`
> **Status:** Undiscovered
> When the party defeats the [[Asylum Demon]] they will unlock this bonfire.

> [!check] Returning to free [[Helena of Astora|Helena]]
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] will thank the players and tell them she's headed to back to [[Firelink Shrine]] as she'll be more use at the forge their since her brother Andre is gone.
> 
> She will also mention that the demon's titanite forge is deeper within the Asylum where her smithing supplies, armor and weapons are. She will offer her services and any titanite she might have with her supplies if they are returned to her.

- [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum#Encounter Table]] roll if the players continue down either path.

> [!recite] The Two Paths
> Beyond the bonfire left behind by the demon are two corridors. One seems to contain more of the same cells you saw on the floor above, the other has a faint orange-red glow coming from further down.
