> An old woman in faded, red decorative robes. She does not have the Darksign upon her, yet she seems impossibly old.

The handmaiden to [[The Firekeeper]], she is responsible for keeping the kindled undead who travel through [[Firelink Shrine]] stocked with supplies. Ultimately she is quite helpful despite her eerie vibes.

Her name and where she comes from remain a mystery.
