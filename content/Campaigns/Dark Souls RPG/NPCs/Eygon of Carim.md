> [!recite] Description
> A stoic figure in armor that seems to be made of stone. He wears a fearsome helmet shaped like a dragon's head and wields a great hammer that looks more like a giant, upturned church-bell than a weapon. 

After Carim was beset by Hollows and the Undead Curse, Eygon was one of the last Knights of Carim to survive the collapse of his home nation. He made his way to Lothric in hopes to either join the Twin Princes armies or link the fire once more -- whichever was more convenient. Along the way he met [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] and began to travel with her.

Eygon is a difficult person to be around as he is usually gruff and abrasive. He seldom warms to people unless they prove themselves worthy of his time. [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] -- to whom he has a great affection for -- is an exception to this.
