Irina of Carim is an aspiring Firekeeper from Carim. She is soft-spoken and kind, always looking to help where she can. Despite her blindness she often sees more than the average person and is remarkably observant.

After being cast out by her family when she was afflicted by the Undead curse she swore to join the order of Firekeepers at the [[Firelink Shrine]] and aid those seeking to link the flame.

She met [[Eygon of Carim]] on the road from Carim to Lothric. At first a relationship out of convenience, she soon learned to trust and rely on [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]].

> [!recite] Description
> A woman in a set of dirty, white traveling vestments and a loose piece of fabric across her eyes. Although you are unable to meet her gaze, you are left with the impression that whatever impairs her vision does not impair the only kind of sight that matters: insight.
