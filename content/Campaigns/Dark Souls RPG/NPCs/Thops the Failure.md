> [!recite] Description
> An older man with a youthful air about him that hints at more of a thoughtless and naive than free-spirited nature. He is bald save for his an impressive grey beard and wears flowing blue and red robes of a fashion you are not familiar with.

Thops is a scholar from the great academy of Raya Lucaria. A brilliant and inventive mind held back by his clumsy and thoughtless nature. His carelessness was deemed dangerous to himself and others and was not allowed to graduate.

He later would travel to Lothric to uncover the secrets of their crystal magics in hopes to prove to his peers in Raya Lucaria that he was capable of great things.

## Quick Info
