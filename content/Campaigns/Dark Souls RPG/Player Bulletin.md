## Quests

### Main Quests

> [!map|subtitle] Call of the Fire *Main Quest*
> - We currently do not know who/where the other three great souls are that we require to link the flame.
> - We were encouraged by [[The Firekeeper]] to find and kill Pontiff Sulyvahn in the Boreal Valley to continue the process of linking the flame. 
> - ~~Our path to [[Firelink Shrine]] is currently blocked by [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)]] who seems to be in some sort of suspended stasis~~
> - ~~[[Helena of Astora]] offered to help fight [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|Gundyr]] upon returning her weapons, armor and smiths tools from a forge within the [[Old Asylum]].~~

> [!map|subtitle] Demons Under Lothric *Main Quest*
> 
> - We found a path leading deeper underground in the [[Old Asylum#The Old Forge|forge]] beneath the [[Old Asylum]]
> - We met a strange demon woman who asked us to join the "Flame of Chaos" which seems to be a twisted version of of the First Flame. 
> - This also seems tied to the Bed of Chaos, an experiment by the ancient Witch of Izalith and the progenitor of demon kind.
> - ~~For some reason, demons have taken residence in the [[Old Asylum]]. Perhaps they are just nesting or perhaps something far more sinister is going on...~~

### Side Quests

> [!map|subtitle] The Monster of the Crevice *Side Quest*
> 
> - [[Thops the Failure|Thops]] lost his notes on Crystal Sorceries in a crevice containing a "crystal beast" while studying it. It seems quite dangerous.

> - [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] and [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] wish to speak with us in [[Firelink Shrine#The Living Quarters]]
> - The figures introduced themselves as [[Irina of Carim]] and [[Eygon of Carim]] and we escorted them to [[Firelink Shrine]]
