# Session-02 The Warden of the Asylum

> [!clock|subtitle no-h] Recap *08/10/2023*
> The party made their way into the grounds of the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum|Old Asylum]] where they fought some Hollows and a boar.
> 
> They made their way into the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum|Old Asylum]] finding it suspiciously devoid of imprisoned Hollows. Instead they found [[Helena of Astora]] who Oedo remembered as the woman who forged his armor (as well as his brothers) and Gronk remembered her as the sister of the master jeweler Enrique who he apprenticed under.

> **LORE**
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] told the party that she was imprisoned when she and her brothers Enrique and Andre succumbed to the undead curse. King Oceiros of Lothric sentenced them to imprisonment in the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/Locations/Old Asylum|Old Asylum]]. Somehow Enrique escaped his sentencing, leaving Andre and [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] to be imprisoned where they were forced by the new demon inhabitants to forge weapon and armors for some unknown goal. Eventually Andre went Hollow and was released when the demons decided to set the imprisoned Hollows upon Lothric. It is unclear what happened to the those Hollows.
> 
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] asked Oedo and the party to kill the demon warden in the atrium below in order to get the keys to free her. After a difficult fight the party successfully stubbed the demon to death and free Helena. She thanked the party offering her help in defeating Gundyr and her services upon reaching [[Firelink Shrine]]. She asked the party to help retrieve her possessions which were left in the forge much deeper in the asylum.

> **LORE**
> [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] also revealed that Oedo's brothers (Gold Knight Bedo, Silver Knight Ledo and Bronze Knight Kedo) were responsible for locking her and Andre away and swore vengeance upon them.
