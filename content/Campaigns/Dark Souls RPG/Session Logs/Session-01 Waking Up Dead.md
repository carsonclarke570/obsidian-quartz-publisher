# Session-01 Waking Up Dead

> [!clock|subtitle no-h] Recap *2023-07-27T00:00:00.000-04:00*
> The party awoke in the Cemetery of Ash, once again feeling the call of the First Fire. 
> 
> After an uphill battle against some skeletons and undead dogs, the party made its way out of the graveyard where they found several paths forward. One toward an old shrine where a bell tolls, one toward an asylum, one toward the nation of Carim where two figures stood and one into a dark crevice.
> 
>  A sorcerer named [[Thops the Failure|Thops]] resting in a crevice warned the party about a "crystal beast" further within the crevice and offered to teach some spells and sell some gear.
> 
> The party then went to checkout a guardhouse blocking their way to the shrine which they determined was [[Firelink Shrine]], home of the Firekeepers. They noped out after seeing a giant knight impaled by a coiled sword.
> 
> After a few encounters with some untrustworthy chests, the party decided to make their way toward the asylum where they remembered that the more dangerous Hollows were imprisoned. The session ended with the party approaching the wrought-iron gate of the Asylum grounds.
