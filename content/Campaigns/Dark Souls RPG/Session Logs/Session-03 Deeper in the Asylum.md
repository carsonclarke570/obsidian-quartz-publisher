# Recap

> [!clock|subtitle no-h] Recap *08/24/2023*
> The party made their way deeper into the [[Old Asylum]] with the intent of finding [[Helena of Astora|Helena's]] gear.
> 
> Following a glow from one of the passages, they found an unidentified demon woman who attempted to persuade the party to join the "Flame of Chaos". After forcing the party the relive some of their most traumatic memories, the party was able to overcome the demon woman and kill her. The party surmised that whatever this "Flame of Chaos" was it was likely related to the Bed of Chaos. They also found several papers referring to a person by the name of Quelara and references to the Daughters of Chaos.
> 
> The party then made their way to a storeroom which seemed to be hosting an array of weapons up until recently. They also found several pieces of papyrus that they were unable to read. 
>
> They made their way into the forge where they got the drop on a [[Crow Demon]] and managed to narrowly avoid being boiled alive by molten metal. The party was then able to recover the missing smith supplies and return to the [[Old Asylum#The Atrium|Atrium]].
