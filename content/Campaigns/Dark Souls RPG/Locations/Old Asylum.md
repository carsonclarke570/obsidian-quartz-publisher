# The Old Asylum

Being buried in the [[Cemetery of Ash]] is almost honorable compared to being condemned to the Old Asylum. Here Undead who had gone fully Hollow and mad would be imprisoned for the safety of Lothric.

The once military barrack turned asylum is now home to the demons and monstrosities who once served as the brutal wardens for the Asylum.

# Areas 

## Outer Grounds 
The grounds outside the Old Asylum are filled with lost Hollows. Once imprisoned within the Asylum they now wander aimlessly within the iron confines of the Asylum's grounds.

> **Status:** Discovered
> You found this bonfire upon approaching the entrance to the [[Old Asylum]].

## First Floor Cells 
Once home to the imprisoned Hollows, they are now dilapidated and filled with demons and monsters that have made the Asylum home.

## The Atrium
Beneath the first floor is a large atrium, once used as training room when the Asylum was a barrack. From here there are a few paths forward.

> You found this bonfire upon defeating the [[Asylum Demon]].

## The Demon Quarters
Some of the basement cells have been converted to "living" quarters for the demons. Within sleep horrors from beneath the earth.

Leads to [[#Storeroom]].

## Chaos Altar
An altar to the Bed of Chaos: a sickening approximation of the First Flame. It's existence in the Asylum hints at even more nefarious reason for the presence of the Demons.

Leads to [[#Storeroom]].

## Storeroom
An old storeroom which has been repurposed as an operation staging ground.

## The Old Forge
Somewhere below the Atrium is an old forge that was once used as part of the barracks. Beyond it is a path leading deep underground.
