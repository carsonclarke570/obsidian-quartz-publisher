# Cemetery of Ash

The Cemetery of Ash sits at the edge of Lothric's borders. It is where followers of the gods bury their Kindled Undead in hopes that they will be dissuaded from seeking to link the First Flame. 

Those with the drive to actually traverse the cemetery will encounter [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|Iudex Gundyr]], the sentinel guarding the one and only exit from the graveyard. Many an Undead goes hollow while seeking to escape the cemetery.

# Areas 
##  The Graveyard
Old and decrepit, what was once a well-kept graveyard has fallen into disarray. Now the bodies of Kindled Undead lay in heaps, awaiting the day that the call of the dying fire wakes them from death. The sounds of mad hollows echo off the collapsed stone structures in the graveyard.

> **Status:** Discovered
> You found this bonfire upon awaking in the [[Cemetery of Ash]]

## The Crossroads
Outside the graveyard there are several paths. One leading deeper into the mountains and two leading towards the decrepit shrine on the hill beyond.

> [!branch]- The Crossroads
> **Path to Crystal Lizard Den**
> Along the edge of the graveyard is a crevice in the rock forming a sort of pathway. Following the path leads to the [[#Crystal Beast's Den]].
> 
> **Path to Carim**
> An old cobblestone path leading away from Lothric and into the mountains. It looks incredibly dangerous and seems to have crumbled away to the point that it is no longer traversable by foot.
> 
> **Path to The [[Old Asylum]]**
> Along the way to the shrine is another path leading to the [[Old Asylum]] where hollows who have gone mad were once imprisoned.
>
> **Path to Shrine**
> A winding path up toward a faraway hill with a collapsed shrine.

## Crystal Beast Den
A clearing in the rock where a beast has made it's home. Perhaps it's guarding something valuable...

## Carim Way
The old path to Carim that runs along the mountains. It's now collapsed into ruin and now is un-passable on foot.

## Gundyrs Post
An old guard post of [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|Iudex Gundyr]] that blocks the way to the [[Firelink Shrine]].
