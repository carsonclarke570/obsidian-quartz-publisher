# Location
A network of corridors weave throughout the structure. The upper floor hosts a huge empty throne that overlooks the bonfire below, which can be lit with theÂ [[Coiled Sword]]. Behind the fire is a small set of steps leading to an altar.

# Areas 

## The Shrine
A circular chamber with four pedestals and a throne. In the center of the room is a bonfire. [[The Firekeeper]] tends to this room awaiting the arrival of an undead seeking to link the fire.

## The Forge
An old titanite forge used by blacksmiths in service of the Kindled Undead. It is a well-equipped armory although several lacking in raw materials.

## The Living Quarters
Wayward undead or those seeking to study under the Firekeepers stay in the small rooms in the corridors adjacent to the main shrine. You never know what type of folk might be roaming these halls...
