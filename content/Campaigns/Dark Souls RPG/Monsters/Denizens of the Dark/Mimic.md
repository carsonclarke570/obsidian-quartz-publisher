# Mimic

Capable of adopting the image of a treasure chest, or other innocuous object, the Mimic is an ambush predator, luring in explorers and adventurers with the promise of loot, before snapping their enormous mouths closed around investigating hands. Most probably created by a wizard with a cruel sense of humour, and a penchant for punishing those thieves trying to purloin valuable spells.
