# Crow Demon

Banished or fled to The Painted World, none can say, but these aloof beings have made their nests in this bleak vista. They are tall and imposing creatures; inky black feathers on their faces and arms soaking up the light around them until giving way to the pale human-like flesh on the rest of their emaciated bodies. They flock together, often gliding in the cloud line, ghosts in the fog, content to be alone together until they are roused to anger. When defending themselves they will divebomb interlopers; cruel beaks seeking exposed flesh to tear at, midnight feathers shrouding their target until they are no longer a threat.
