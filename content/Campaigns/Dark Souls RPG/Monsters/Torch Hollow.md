# Torch Hollow
ï»¿  The spark of life long faded behind dead eyes, the Torch Hollow attacks with grim determination, lured by the power of the living and reborn into a hollow cycle of death. Unlike their armoured soldier brethren, torch hollows are armed with only a lit torch: a symbol of the flame of life that will ever elude them. Faster and more nimble, these Hollows can prove a significant challenge to even the most seasoned warrior as they lash out with a flaming frenzy.
