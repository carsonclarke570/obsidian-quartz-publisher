# Demonic Foliage

Trailing earth behind it, Demonic Foliage is precisely what it sounds likeâ€”a plant-like creature, animated by some foul curse, seeking out anything it can find to overwhelm and consume. Nasty, vicious things, the most effective means of dealing with such an infestation is fire, and a stout axe.
