# Skeleton
Ancient soldiers, dragged back from the peace of the grave, to once more hack away at the living -- or at least, more alive -- with swords, and spears, and whatever else their fingers can fasten around. Despite their fearsome appearance, they can be quickly defeated -- mighty in the past, perhaps, but no longer.
