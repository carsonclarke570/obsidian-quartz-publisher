# Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)
How bitter the fate of Iudex Gundyr. To arrive as a champion at the [[Firelink shrine]], and to find it empty.

Dead. No ember to spark, no bell to ring. Nothing. Only the certainty of his own failure. So it was that Gundyr appointed himself the judge of any who would kindle the fire, and link the shrines. So it was that Gundyr decided any who would do what he was denied must prove themselves better than him.

Until now, none have.
