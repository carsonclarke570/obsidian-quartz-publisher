# Asylum Demon
Clutching a gigantic mace, its segmented stomach undulating and rippling with grotesque animation, such demons are often set as guards, preventing entrance (or exit) to or from some sacred spot. The creature gains its name from its infamous position as warden of the Undead Asylum in Lordran. There, any undead attempting to escape the gloom and misery of that unwholesome prison were smashed to pieces beneath its vast, crushing blows. It was eventually slain by the Chosen Undead. Whatever happened to them?
