# Undead Attack Dog
Cold, grey flesh and toughened hides, vicious gnashing teeth capable of tearing through flesh and bone with ease; undead attack dogs are fearsome allies of undead soldiers and other hollows. Dangerous alone and deadly in a pack, these dogs are nimble and adept at dodging even the swiftest blow, often leaping from the shadows to tear chunks from exposed flesh. Relentless in their pursuit, these feral creatures stalk their prey ruthlessly, their hollow barks echoing around castle walls.
