# Large Mushroom Person

It is unknown when the spark of sentience seized these fungi, but, over time, it has grown, metastasizing until it became consciousness. The creatures are unusual, as might be expected, and their intelligence, such as it is, seems rudimentaryâ€”whenever they see a creature different from themselves, they charge towards it, attempting to bring it down, whether it appears hostile or not. Perhaps they might become something more in ages to come; for now, however, they are merely an irritant.
