# Darklurker
It is best not to ask what a Darklurker is, in truth. After all, it resembles an angel so closely, as its vast, beautiful wings spread open behind it, that the notion even the hosts of heaven are subject to the curse might lead even the most hopeful to despair. Hugely powerful, the Darklurker strikes from above, bringing its sword down upon the unwary in devastating attacks, capable of slicing an armored knight in half with a single swing. No matter how fiercely a battle rages, though, the Darklurkerâ€™s hood remains up, obscuring its face entirely.
