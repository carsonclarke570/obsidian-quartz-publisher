# Cragspider

With eight legs, eight eyes, a vast bulbous underside, and the capacity to breathe fifire at any it elects to make its prey, Cragspiders are endlessly dangerous. As if this weren’t enough to render them creatures worthy of fear, they also possess wings. The wings, fortunately, are more vestigial than functional— they enable the spiders to hover for a brief time, before descending on their prey.
