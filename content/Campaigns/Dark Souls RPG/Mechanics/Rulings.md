# Rulings

## Skill Checks
> [!rule-fix|subtitle] Skill Checks *Group Checks*
> Occasionally a "Group Check" will be called for. When this occurs the party will either:
> - Elect a single person to attempt the check
> - All attempt the check with a success being determined by half or more of the players passing the check.

> [!rule-fix|subtitle] Skill Checks *Help Action*
> When using the Help Action, both players roll for the check with their own bonuses and take the highest between the two of them

## Combat
> [!rule-fix|subtitle] Combat *Weapons in Combat*
> - **Switching weapons in combat is takes an action.**
>    This is to prevent mid-to-late game weapons from being freely swapped and abused during combat. 
> - **Putting away a weapon in combat is a free action.** 
>     This is to allow the use of a catalyst to buff a two-handed weapon and strike with it in the same turn.

> [!rule-fix|subtitle] Combat *Initiative Groups*
> If a player (or enemy) is adjacent to an ally in their initiative rolls they may be grouped into an **Initiative Group** at the DM's discretion.
> 
> Individuals in the same **Initiative Group** take their turns together and can freely organize what order they take their *Movements, Actions, Bonus Actions and Reactions*.

## Items
> [!spell-fix|subtitle] Spells *Sorcery*
> - **Changing the duration of [[Magic Weapon]] to last until the caster's next turn.**
>    This is to bring the spell more in-line with 5th Edition's Shield spell which is functionally similar.
> - **Changing [[Hush]] to require concentration.**
>   This is to bring it more in-line with 5th Edition's Pass Without Trace spell which is functionally similar.
