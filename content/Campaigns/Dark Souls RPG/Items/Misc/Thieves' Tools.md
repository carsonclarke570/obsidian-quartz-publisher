# Thieves' Tools
**Cost:** 100
This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.

## Mechanics
Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm [[Traps]] or open locks. 

Without proficiency, these tools just allow you nullify any disadvantage an unfamiliar lock or trap would pose.

Perhaps you can find a tutor to train you in the ways of the thief...
