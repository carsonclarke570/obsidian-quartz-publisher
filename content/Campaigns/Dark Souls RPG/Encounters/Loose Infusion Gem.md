# Loose Infusion Gem

#### Encounter
> [!recite] The Gem
> You almost miss it as your traveling but on the ground ahead of you is unusual rock the size of your palm. The surface of the rock shifts colors like an oil slick and beneath the surface you can feel a churn of energy emanating from it -- bouncing between states of being. 
> 
> Whatever this stone is, it seems transitory --  as though its almost trying to decide what it should be. You remember an old saying: "To be transitory is to be lost and the lost desire a soul". Perhaps an offering of one of your souls will help it become whatever it is trying to be.

- Giving the stone a single soul will imbue it with an infusion. Use the tables below to determine which gem it becomes.
