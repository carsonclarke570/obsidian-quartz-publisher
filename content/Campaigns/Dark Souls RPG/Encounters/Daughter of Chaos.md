> [!info]- Oedo's Memories
> You’re a kid again in the Royal Gardens of Castle Lothric. This was back at the height of the Lothric. Before the undead curse had spread to your land, before Lothric began to crumble and before King Oceiros went mad.
> 
> You’re walking with your older brother Ledo when he stops, sighs and turns to you.
> 
> “Oedo, you’re just not old enough, kid. Just because Kedo let’s you win every time you spar doesn’t mean you’re ready to try out for the Guard. Maybe next year okay?”
> **How do you think Oedo felt in this moment? What did you do?**
> 
> The memory fades and jumps ahead. You see your official knighting ceremony where you were gifted your Copper Armor. Your brothers Kedo and Bedo laught uproariously and clap you on the back but Ledo just gives you a forced smile and shakes your hand.
> 
> Memories flash faster and faster. Guard duty. Monster hunting. Battles. Wars. Each time you bled and scraped your way through and each time Ledo grew more cold towards you. But why? Why couldn’t your own bröther acknowledge you. Be proud of you?
> 
> The memories suddenly slow landing on a day that you recognize slightly through your clouded undead memory. It’s you and Ledo on a mountaintop. You’re bleeding heavily and he looms over you. He spits some blood out of his own mouth and speaks: “Why couldn’t you stay behind? Why couldn’t you let the adults handle it for once? This could have been over in one goddamn night and now we’ll be fighting a full-blown war soon! You and your stupid high horse. Can’t you just do as your told?”
> 
> You don’t remember why he’s yelling at you, only that you were trying to help. Trying to save someone? 
> **How do you think Oedo felt in this moment? What did you do?**
> 
> Ledo pushes you to the ground and walks away, leaving you weak and helpless against the stone of the mountain. Your consciousness fades in and out as the blood pours out of you. The last thing you see and hear as you die is the face Bedreid, standing over you crying and apologizing although at the time you did not recognize him.

> [!info]- Gronk's Memories
> You're sitting at your workbench working on a lock and a set of keys. Turning the metal contraption over in your hand you mutter some curses under your breath. You really wish old man Henderson would stop getting himself locked out of his house but you can't really complain about the work -- what with all the new taxes coming from the Pontiff Sulyvahn. You sigh wishing that your tutor Enrique the Master Jeweler was here to help you with the work anyway.
> 
> Flash forward a few years and conditions in your home of Lower Irithyll have grown worse. The Pontiff has begun conscripting the citizens into a war with Lothric's royal family. You haven't really been following it but something about the Mad King Oceiros and taking advantage of the conflict with the Everlasting Dragons to claim Lothric for the Deep. They drafted old man Henderson the other day and the Outrider Knights brought back another dozen coffins this morning. 
> **How do you think Gronk felt in this moment? What did you do?**
> 
> A couple months later Irithyll is in chaos. The Pontiff has appointed the Deacons of the Deep to cleanse the non-believers from Irithyll and unfortunately Lower Irithyll still holds faith in the Fire. The Outrider Knights have been dispatched to cull the citizens. You're no blacksmith but you help the town where you can in arming themselves.
> 
> The next weeks are a haze. You help the townsfolk organize. You build barricades. You fight. The Deacons send hollows, monsters from the abyss and the pontiff knights to raze the town. And you make a stand. Oh you make a stand. You stake a claim in this tiny village in the Irithyll Valley and you stand. 
> 
> For three bloody weeks you hold the line. Friends, family and faces you've known for years fall one by one around you. On the fourth week the barricades fall. And so you take the front lines but you're not prepared and are speared through the chest by an Outrider Knight within minutes.
> **How do you think Gronk felt in this moment? What did you do?**
> 
> You swear the last thing you see is Enrique, you teacher, riding into battle surrounded by several dozen knights wearing armor with the sigil of the sun on it.

> [!info]- Bedreid's Memory
> You remember sitting on a stone bench outdoors in Archdragon Peak as kid. Next to you is your childhood friend Edwin and he's whispering something funny in your year. You and Edwin snicker but quickly quiet as Selune's scaly face turns to you exhales in annoyance. You blush and turn back to your book as Selune continues her recitation.
> 
> Moments studying under Selune with Edwin flash by. Casting your first soul sorcery. Learning the history of the dragons. All the while Edwin by your side. You were always an quick learner but as you grew older Edwin seemed to surpass you. He learned faster. Was more curious. All the while his mischievous, affable personality sliding away to reveal a hardened, curious scholar. Despite this growing gap the two of you remained thick as thieves. 
> **How do you think Bedreid felt in this moment? What did you do?**
> 
> You see yourself and Edwin as teenagers. You remember the first of many arguments between Edwin and Selune. Edwin demanding that Selune and the rest of the Everlasting Dragons were withholding knowledge from him and an annoyed Selune informing Edwin that he was "too young" and "not ready" for it. Edwin complained to you in his free time but after some time he seemed to let the issue drop.
> 
> Then one day, they came. Just four royal soldiers from Castle Lothric. One wearing gold armor. One wearing silver. One wearing bronze. And one wearing copper. They were accompanied by Edwin so you payed them no mind. Until you heard the screams.
> 
> You ran from your studies to find a massacre. Selune dead. Several of the other dragons dead. The other students dead. Beyond them you see the four knights. All four are covered in the crimson blood of your friends. You look closer and see the copper one has been beaten within an inch of his life. The silver one stands over him asking him something about "why did you try to stop us?". 
> 
> You take a step forward but a hand lands on your shoulder and stops you. You turn to see Edwin covered in.. someone else's blood. He has a pained look on his face and he says: "I'm sorry Bedreid, I.. I didn't know what they were here for. They told me they'd give me access to the archives and then.. I killed them. I'm sorry. I helped them kill. I was just so desperate. It's not my fault. I.. just -- why didn't Selune just let me in! None of this would have happened if they just--".
> **How do you think Bedreid felt in this moment? What did you do?**
>
> You don't remember all of what happens next. You remember kneeling over the copper knight and demanding what happened. You remember chasing Edwin across Lothric as quest for knowledge and growing madness worsened. You remember cornering him at last. And you remember the feeling of cold steel as your friend twisted a blade into your heart.

> [!info]- Baasilard's Memories
> You remember the first time you died. Well, you remember what you can at least. You remember being deep underground. Then being buried alive. Then suffocating under the weight on mud, stone and blood. 
> 
>Then blackness.
>
>Then a sun. A yellow sun emblazoned on silver and white armor. A helmet like a bucket. And a hand pulling you out of the rubble. The knight introduces himself as Solaire and asks if you'd like to engage in jolly cooperation with him.
>**How do you think Baasilard felt in this moment? What did you do?** 
> 
> You travel with Solaire and his small band called the Warriors of Sunlight. You help those in need and protect them from those who would seek to invade their lives. As time goes on the members of the Warriors of Sunlight change hands but you and Solaire remain. And you help when and where you can.
> 
> One day he tells you that the king has gone mad and has ordered Pontiff Sulyvahn and the Deacons of the Deep to claim all of the Boreal Valley for the Deep. With solemn expression he tells you that he worries about what's to come and asks if you'll join him in protecting the villagers of Irithyll and the rest of the Boreal Valley.
> **How do you think Baasilard felt in this moment? What did you do?** 
> 
> You died many times in the months that followed. You fought the Deacons and their abyssal minions at every turn. Yet you rose each time and fought on. Ignoring the signs and symptoms  of going Hollow until eventually your voice failed you for the last time. 
> 
> One day you were too late. Solaire rode out early that morning with the remaining Warriors of Sunlight to help combat the Deacons approach on Lower Irithyll. You stayed back as you were recovering from your most return from death, fighting symptoms of Hollowfication. When you finally reached Lower Irithyll it was too late.
> 
> You found Solaire and the Warriors of Sunlight donning the regalia of the Deacons and with a terrible red glow in their eyes. A red glow you knew well as the eyes of beasts claimed by the abyss.
> **How do you think Baasilard felt in this moment? What did you do?** 
> 
> And so it was at the hand of your leader and friend you were killed once more.
