# Iudex Gundyr's Arena

#### Encounter

```encounter
name: Iudex Gundyr Arena
players:
  - Jim
  - Dan
  - Warren
  - Ryan
creatures:
  - 1: Iudex Gundyr
```

#### Combat

**NPC Tactics:**
- [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] and [[Helena of Astora|Helena]] will get close and make melee attacks.
- [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will keep her distance and cast [[Heal]] and [[Blessing of the Archtree]].

#### Statblocks
> [!encounter]- [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)]]
> ![[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)|clean]]

> [!encounter]- [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 2)]]
> ![[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 2)|clean]]

#### Notes

The party can take about **150** points of damage and about **200** with [[Helena of Astora|Helena]], [[Eygon of Carim|Eygon]] and [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] helping. This is excluding the fact that [[Irina of Carim|Irina]] will exclusively use [[Heal]] on the party.

Assuming Iudex deals about **20 - 25 DPR**, that gives the party about **8-10** rounds to defeat him. The party on the other hand should be outputting about **24 DPR** and with their companions should be closer to **30 DPR**.

This means that conservatively Iudex should have about **240**, so let's say **220**.

The fight is broken into three phases:

| Phase                                 | Damage Output | Health |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)]]            | 18ish         | 80     |
| [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 1)]] - Bloodied | 20ish         | 80     |
| [[Iudex Gundyr (Phase 2)]]            | 25ish         | 60     |

##### Recites
> [!recite] Phase 1 - Iudex Gundyr
> With a powerful tug, you manage to pull the coiled sword from the statue. As the blade slides out it ignites sparks along the blade causing tiny flames to burst into life and quickly fade. As though starting an engine, these flames seems to spur life into the statues as it's eyes alight with a red glow and slowly stands brandishing a wicked looking halberd. It nods its head at you and slowly takes a low fighting stance beckoning you to challenge it.

> [!recite] Phase 2- Bloodied
> Gundyr staggers as one side of his armor shatters revealing decrepit undead skin bubbling with the black pus of the darkness. The oily black pus bubbles and expands, bursting out in a flurry of undulating darkness. It takes the rough form of beast or dragon where Gundyr's right arm used to be. The bestial arm rears its head and screeches an inhuman roar. 

> [!recite] On Defeat
> Gundyr falls to one knee and then immediately collapses as his weight can't hold him. He falls to ground motionless.

> [!recite] Phase 3 - Pus of Man
> You hear a screech and turn around to see the black pus has shed Gundyr's armor is standing over the remains of Gundyr's body. Where most would succumb to the dark's call, Gundyr's might has bent this oily blackness into his form. The darkness takes his shape, forming a shadowy version of the former guard of [[Firelink Shrine]] in that same low to the ground fighting stance. Before you stands unwavering will of Iudex Gundyr personified and you *will* rise to his challenge.
