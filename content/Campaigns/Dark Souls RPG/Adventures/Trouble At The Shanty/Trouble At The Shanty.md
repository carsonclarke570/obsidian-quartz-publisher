# Adventure Plan
???

# Story Circle
After chasing [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/03. Non Player Characters/Bronze Knight Kedo.md|Kedo]] to the [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/05. Locations/Undead Shanty.md|Undead Shanty]], the party must come to terms with Kedo's new role as the captain of [[Campaigns/Dark Souls RPG/06. Factions/The Canaries.md|The Canaries]], the guards in town, and uncover the source of the recent attacks on the shanty.

## You 
The party has discovered that [[Oedo]]'s brother has been spotted in the [[Undead Shanty|Undead Shanty]]

## Need
[[Oedo]] and [[Bedreid]] want revenge or answers for Kedo's part in the massacre at [[Archdragon Peak|Archdragon Peak]]

## Go
Upon arriving, the party discovers that Kedo is the current captain of a group of mercenaries protecting the undead of the shanty from strange dragon-like creatures assaulting the shanty and abducting the undead.

## Search
The players may still harbor suspicion about Kedo's involvement here but they will likely want to help discover the cause of the of these attacks and abductions.

## Find
They will discover that[[Edwin of Vinheim|Edwin]]has been chasing after Kedo for revenge and making the [[Draconic Experiment|Draconic Experiments]] on behalf of King Ocerious who has promised the whereabouts of the other two brothers in return for a more perfect draconic transformation. 

## Take
The players need to stop Edwin, although he flees upon realizing that [[Bedreid]] is there. Before he escapes, he looses a bear inflicted with his draconic experiments on the town.

## Return
The players fight against the draconic bear and several [[Draconic Experiment|Draconic Experiments]] alongside Kedo and his guardsmen.

## Change
The players either accept Kedo's change of heart or begrudgingly accept it. Either way, as a truce, he offers the Bronze Knight Armor to [[Oedo]].
